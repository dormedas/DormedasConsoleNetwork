	First, let me thank you for downloading this little example program,
I spent an entire weekend staring at code trying to make this work, and
without touching the keyboard, it magically happened.

	The program is very simply a console application wherein a client
uses the arrow keys to move a corresponding character (literally). It then
sends this data off to a server, which then relays that data to any connected
clients.

	Arrow keys after you've specified a server's ip address and port and
a character to 'play' as.
